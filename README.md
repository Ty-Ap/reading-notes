**growth mindset consists of**

1. Accepting failure as a *precursor* to success, not a barrier
2. Making room to be human as we engage with difficult concepts.
3. Moving forward while remaining gentle to yourself.

**some reminders**

- Plan space and time for Self Care.
- Reach out to others, for help **and** community. 
- You have neurodivergence, hold yourself to *your* standard, not a Neurotypical standard.
