# These are Github Notes

github is a DCVS which stands for distributed version control system. This means it stores mirrored repositories and backups of each pushed version, which mitigates against catastrophic losses.
this also allows for "post mortems" when things go really wrong

Git prevents data and version losses by logging changes in an itemized chronological order.

files in git are usually in three main states,

- comitted = data stored in local database
- modified = data changed but not comitted to database
- staged = changes are local and not comitted
