 JavaScript

from mdn.com

-JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.

While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
 JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments.

What this all means, is that Javascript is a versatile, widespread language capable of accomplishing many tasks and functions.
