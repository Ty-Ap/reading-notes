# Text Editor Basic Notes

Choosing a text editor is a personal choice that often boils down to "did it work?"
There's seemingly endless text editors so to simplify, let's discuss the differences between basic text editors, and code specific text editors.

## Basic

- often comes without extra tools , such as syntax highlighting, and command lists.
- often not very user friendly.
- "comes with the kit" meaning, often comes along with the machine

### Code Specific

- often third party.
- comes with bonus tools and quality of life improvements like syntax highlighters, etc.

### IDE

- stands for "Integrated Develeopment Environment"
- combines many pros of both kinds of text editors.
- provides many common developer tools in one convenient place.

#### Basic Text Editor Functions

  text editors typically parse commands left to right. These commands are text based and follow language specific syntax. some basic commands for Linux are
  --ls to list files
  --pwd for " print working directory" or in english, "where am I?"
 the list goes on and has many different variations and sub functions.
