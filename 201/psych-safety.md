# Discussion Questions

What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

- Diversity, trust, and empathy.

## Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

- a previous company I worked for touted on and on about how diverse and open they were, but i didnt feel safe there at all as a person, and definitely not as a queer person. the place was built entirely on robotic yes men where both ideas and concerns went to die. i was fired for disclosing wages with my coworkers and shortly after sued them for breaking labor laws.

### What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

- teams that operate safely and respectfully within an organization dont have to waste time making a paper trail after every meeting and siccing lawyers on HR.
