Readings: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table

- td- this stands for table data and makes up what goes into each box or cell
- th- table header, makes items here bolded and easier to read. typically for naming the type of data to follow, and readability
- tr- table row, this is what is sounds like and tells info to follow to arrange itself into a row.

What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

- constructors are functions that take in data and turn the lift of data into an object. this lends itself to easier manipulation, modularity, and less data usage.
  
How does the term .this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

- .this in an object literal only has the scope of that specific object. using .this. in a constructor will call back to specific iterations of objects the function built.

Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

- I'll do one from everyones previous work experience. Protoypes are like the new kid, or a new hire, and they automatically inherit the data of their parent object or trainer. Job description, daily tasks, etc  of their parent object. And if we want to get really abstract, this can chain on to the next new hire, the new hire trains, once they have that data.
