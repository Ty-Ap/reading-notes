There's seemingly endless text editors so to simplify, let's discuss the differences between basic text editors, and code specific text editors. 

**Basic**

-often not very user friendly.
-"comes with the kit" meaning, often comes along with the machine

**code specific**
-often third party.
-comes with bonus tools and quality of life improvements like syntax highlighters, etc.
